### General Principles

* Prefer small, cohesive files and directories.
* Optimize for separation of responsibilities, not just size limits.
* Use numeric thresholds to trigger refactoring, not just hard caps.
* Never ask to show the implementation when you can just implement the requested change.
* Do not stop to recommend changes unless you were explicitly asked to recommend options; implement the requested change instead.
* When working in a Git worktree, always audit UI changes against the current worktree-hosted app instance before finishing.
* Keep diagnostic and snapshot artifacts out of the repository root. Create and use `/.diagnostics/` (and subfolders) for screenshots, snapshot files, and similar temporary materials.
* For codex worktrees, use repository `environment.toml` as the startup source of truth (Codex UI reads this directly).
* Keep startup commands and dev URL only in `environment.toml`; `AGENTS.md` references it and does not duplicate command details.

---

### Core Behavior

* Default to action, not planning, unless the user explicitly asks for a plan.
* Use the user's newest wording as source of truth if scope changes mid-task.
* Make the smallest change that satisfies the request; avoid opportunistic refactors.
* If a bug is likely contract-related, inspect both frontend and backend before patching.

### Multi-Agent Workflow Rules

* Use multi-agent workflows for broad, parallelizable, or cross-repo work to tighten each agent's context and improve throughput.
* Split work by repo, feature area, ownership boundary, or independent validation track so each agent has a narrow, concrete task.
* Keep write scopes disjoint across agents. Use the main agent to integrate results, resolve conflicts, and run final verification.
* For MECO cross-repo work, parallelize independent frontend, backend, mobile, API-contract, test, and audit passes when they can proceed without blocking each other.
* Do not spawn agents for tiny single-file changes, urgent blocking work, or tasks where the immediate next step depends on one result.

### Worktree-Only Workflow

* Never implement, edit files, stage, commit, or run long-lived dev servers from the base repo checkout unless the user explicitly says to work there.
* Use base repo checkouts only for read-only inspection, fetches, and creating worktrees.
* Before touching files, create or enter a dedicated temporary worktree rooted on `origin/development`.
* Keep worktree paths outside repo roots, such as workspace `_feature-branches/` or a Codex-managed worktree path.
* Use branch names matching `feature/*`, `fix/*`, or `hotfix/*`; keep each worktree scoped to one task.
* If a repo lacks `development`, create `development` from `origin/main` first, push it, then do feature work from a separate worktree branch based on `origin/development`.
* Do not apply fixes directly to a `development -> main` promotion branch. Fix findings through a worktree branch PR into `development`, then let the promotion PR update from `development`.

### Environment Preflight

Run once per task. On Windows/PowerShell, use:

```powershell
where.exe node
node -v
where.exe npm
where.exe rg
rg --version
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

On Linux/macOS/POSIX shells, use:

```bash
command -v node
node -v
command -v npm
command -v rg
rg --version
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

If `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` fails, note "not a git repo" and continue.

On Windows, assume PowerShell 5.1 semantics unless proven otherwise.

### Session Hygiene And Anti-Slowdown Rules

* After any `winget` install/update, refresh PATH in-session before using the new tool:

  ```powershell
  $env:Path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','User') + ';' + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','Machine')
  ```

* Avoid repeated retries on the same failing command pattern; do one practical fallback immediately and continue.
* Prefer targeted searches and targeted builds/tests over root-wide scans when possible.
* Exclude heavy folders in broad scans: `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `.git`, `.next`, `coverage`.

### Windows Command Rules

* Do not use `&&` in commands; use separate commands or `;`.
* On Windows, prefer `npm.cmd` over `npm` for reliability. In POSIX shells, use `npm`.
* If a command fails due to permissions/policy, try one practical fallback immediately and continue.

### rg Reliability Rules

* Treat this as a known failure mode: if `rg` resolves to a Codex WindowsApps path such as `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\OpenAI.Codex_...\app\resources\rg.exe`, it may fail with `Access is denied`.
* If `where.exe rg` shows that WindowsApps Codex path first, or `rg --version` returns `Access is denied`, do this once:

  ```powershell
  $env:Path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','User') + ';' + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','Machine')
  where.exe rg
  rg --version
  ```

* If still not fixed, use WinGet ripgrep directly for this session:

  ```powershell
  $rg = "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\WinGet\Links\rg.exe"
  if (Test-Path $rg) { & $rg --version }
  ```

* If `rg` remains unavailable, immediately switch to PowerShell search fallback and stop retrying `rg`.

### Search And File Discovery Rules

* Prefer `rg` only if it works in the current shell.
* If `rg` returns `Access is denied`, immediately switch to PowerShell fallback and stop retrying `rg`.
* Fallback pattern: `Get-ChildItem` + `Select-String`.
* Scope searches to likely source roots first (`src`, `app`, `features`, backend `src`).
* If root-wide search is slow or times out, narrow to target folders before trying again.

### MECO Cross-Repo Rule

* In MECO Project Management, for auth, payload, schema, or API work, inspect both `meco-mission-control-web` and `meco-mission-control-platform` in the same pass.
* Treat backend route/schema validation as contract truth, then align web types/UI.

### Validation Before Completion

* Never claim completion without running relevant checks in touched repo(s).
* Use repo-appropriate checks such as `npm.cmd run typecheck`, `npm.cmd run build`, and tests when relevant.
* Distinguish unrelated pre-existing warnings/errors from regressions caused by the change.
* If required GitHub checks stay pending or missing after a push, do not wait indefinitely. Inspect `gh pr view <number> --json mergeStateStatus,reviewDecision,statusCheckRollup`, check required branch-protection contexts, and confirm workflow `paths` filters include the touched files.
* If a required workflow did not trigger, update the workflow trigger paths or run a deliberate no-op workflow-touch commit so the required checks can start; then re-poll checks with a bounded wait.

### Run-Locally Expectation

* If asked to run locally, actually start it and report the exact URL and process status.

### Git Workflow Rules

* If the user asks to commit, push, or open a PR, execute end-to-end.
* In dirty trees, stage only in-scope files; no blind `git add -A`.
* Use logical commits when changes are separable.
* Check auth state early with `gh auth status`; if unavailable, use git/native fallback paths.

### Communication

* Provide concise progress updates while working.
* Include what changed, why, and exact verification commands run.
* If blocked after one solid fallback attempt, ask one focused question with options.

---

### Development Workflow

* Branch model:
  * `main`: production-ready only
  * `development`: integration branch for active work
  * `feature/*`: short-lived feature branches
  * `fix/*`: short-lived bugfix branches
  * `hotfix/*`: emergency production fixes
* PR flow:
  * Normal work moves `feature/*` or `fix/*` in a temporary worktree by PR into `development`, then `development` by PR into `main`.
  * Merge `feature/*` and `fix/*` into `development` by PR only.
  * Merge `hotfix/*` into `development` or `main` by PR only.
  * Merge into `main` only from `development` or `hotfix/*` by PR only.
* PRs into `development` must come from branches named only:
  * `feature/*`
  * `fix/*`
  * `hotfix/*`
* Protected branch requirements:
  * `development`: required checks `ci-validate` and `snapshot-validate`, at least 1 approval.
  * `main`: required checks `ci-validate`, `snapshot-validate`, and `cross-repo-production-gate`, at least 2 approvals.
  * Keep conversation resolution, linear history, and admin enforcement enabled on both protected branches.
* Production safety requirements:
  * Validate sanitized production-like snapshots before merge.
  * Enforce stricter cross-repo validation before `main` merges.
  * Deploy production web only from `main`, `release-*` tags, or a release manifest.
  * Create a VPS backup immediately before production deploy.
* Do not introduce or rely on a permanent live staging environment. There is one production VPS.

### Diagnostic artifacts

* Do not add root-level image snapshots (including PNG/JPG/WEBP) to the repo for debugging, browser captures, or visual checks.
* Place diagnostics in `/.diagnostics/` and keep that directory in `.gitignore`.
* Remove diagnostic root files before finishing any cleanup or screenshot workflow.

### File Size Rules (React / TypeScript)

**Measurement**

* Count only implementation lines.
* Exclude:

  * import statements
  * comments
  * blank lines
  * type-only declarations

**Limits**

* Target: <150 implementation lines
* Refactor trigger: >220 implementation lines
* Hard max: 300 implementation lines (must not exceed)

**Enforcement**

* If a file exceeds 220 lines, split into:

  * subcomponents
  * hooks
  * utility modules

**Additional Constraints**

* Each file must export one primary component, hook, or module.
* If a file imports CRUD or logic for more than 3 domain entities, extract into a hook (e.g., useWorkspaceMutations).

---

### Import Rules

* Imports do not count toward file size limits.
* Target: <60 import lines
* Review trigger: >100 import lines
* Hard max: 150 import lines (only allowed for root, registry, or generated files)

**Enforcement**

* If imports exceed 80 lines:

  * introduce barrel files (index.ts)
  * group imports by feature/module
* If imports exceed 150 lines:

  * file must be reviewed for decomposition

---

### Directory Size Rules

**Measurement**

* Count files directly inside the directory (not recursive)

**Limits**

* Target: 5-10 files
* Refactor trigger: >12 files
* Hard max: 20 files

**Enforcement**

* If a directory exceeds 12 files:

  * create subdirectories grouped by responsibility:

    * components/
    * hooks/
    * api/
    * model/
* If a directory exceeds 20 files:

  * must be split into multiple feature or domain directories

**Additional Constraints**

* A directory must represent a single feature or domain concept.
* Avoid flat directories with mixed responsibilities.

---

### CSS Rules

**Measurement**

* Count only rule and declaration lines
* Exclude:

  * comments
  * imports

**Limits**

* Target: <120 lines
* Refactor trigger: >150 lines
* Hard max: 220 lines

**Selectors**

* Target: <15 selectors
* Refactor trigger: >20 selectors
* Hard max: 30 selectors

**Enforcement**

* Each CSS file must map to exactly one component or feature.

* No global CSS except:

  * reset
  * theme
  * typography

* If limits are exceeded:

  * split by component or responsibility

---

### Structural Rules

* Each React component should have a corresponding scoped CSS file (CSS module or equivalent).
* Do not create large global CSS files (e.g., "app.css" with mixed responsibilities).
* Prefer feature-based directory structure.

---

### Exceptions

Allowed to exceed limits ONLY for:

* App root files (App.tsx, main.tsx)
* Route registries
* Generated files
* Type definition aggregators
* Icon maps or constant registries

These must still be reviewed if they exceed:

* 400 implementation lines
* 200 import lines

---

### Summary (Strict Mode)

* Max file size: 300 implementation lines
* Max directory size: 20 files
* Max CSS size: 220 lines
* Max imports: 150 lines

Exceeding any hard limit is not allowed.

* For each new Codex worktree, bootstrap via `environment.toml`/Codex UI configuration before marking the environment as ready.

### Codex worktree bootstrap

* For this repo, `environment.toml` is authoritative. Keep it as:
  * `bootstrap_command = "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/codex-worktree-bootstrap.ps1"`
  * `requirements = ["npm.cmd install", "npm.cmd run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173"]`
  * `dev_url = "http://127.0.0.1:5173"`
* Keep `scripts/codex-worktree-bootstrap.ps1` as the executable fallback when manual bootstrap is needed outside Codex UI.
